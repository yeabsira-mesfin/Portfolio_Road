# An intentet is simply a wire, and a computer connected directly to a wire is called a server.
# Computers we use are called clients since they are not connceted to the the internet directly.
# Everthing connected to the internet has and address called (IP Address)
# Anywhere where two or more parts of the internet intersect there is an equipment called router, which direct our packets to the internet which help us to get more closer to the internet.
# When an information is sent to the server our computer's IP address will be added to the routers IP address and it will reach the destination, then when the information comes back from the internet the IP address is unfolded to the IP addresses it held when it came first.
